# Password-Generator

This project was created to generate a random password based on requirements supplied by the user. When the user clicks the generate password button, a prompt shows asking the user how many characters should the password be. The user is then showed confirm boxes to indicate whether or not numbers, special characters, lowercase characters, and/or uppercase characters should be included in the generated password. The technologies used to create this project were Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
